        clientGoal: `Charis Oil is an online platform that provides seamless automation and coordination of Oil and Gas retail processes and transactions. Charis oil is looking to proactively apply DevOps principles in building a highly scalable, reliable and secure infrastructure.
        
        The key objective Charis oil wants to achieve are the following:
        
        Setting up a continuous integration, delivery, testing and continuous deployment framework to facilitate a higher level of development productivity.
        
        Design of a highly scalable and fault tolerant infrastructure that all applications and services developed by Charis Oil team can confidently rely on.
        
        A micro-service based architecture for components of the Charis Oil application and services.
        
        An Infrastructure Automation to handle the creation and configuration of infrastructure components.
        
        To enable code reusability, setting up Cybersecurity Frameworks and compliance checks to ensure the organizational wide security.`,

        solutionImplemented: `Our team conducted a problem analysis test on Charis Oil, to gain a thorough understanding of their present situation. This test was a mix of qualitative and quantitative research techniques. After the assessment, we recommended a DevOps based AWS microservices architecture. 
        
        This architecture offers all the benefits that the firm sought and would also grow with the companyâ€™s retail technology needs. Our team helped Charis Oil IT team design the AWS based microservices, with auto-scaling and fault tolerance in mind. This would deliver a higher level of service availability and developer productivity. As a result of the AWS microservices architecture, Charis Oil creates a stable platform for her next-generation online retail service for oil and gas products. 
        
        The firm has been able to apply DevOps principles and automations which will allow for much greater automation of the configuration, deployment and delivery process as well as auto-scaling of services. The development team as a result of it's new architecture is spending less time on tactical, manual tasks and more time on strategic solution delivery, ultimately helping the firm deliver the greatest goals of its new engine. Our team also secured the information, systems, and assets of Charis oil using AWS.`,
